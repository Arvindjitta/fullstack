( React, Flask, & MongoDB Atlas Full Stack Project )

This repo houses my full-stack web application, integrating React for a dynamic frontend, Flask for an efficient backend API, and MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based data storage. Aimed at showcasing my full-stack development skills, the project features a single-page application architecture, RESTful backend services, and flexible data management. It serves as a practical demonstration of building and deploying a modern web application from scratch.

Technologies:

Frontend: React
Backend: Flask
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Contributions and feedback are welcome as I aim to continuously improve and expand this project.
