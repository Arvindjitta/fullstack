# Full Stack Web Application: React, Flask, & MongoDB Atlas

This repository houses my full-stack web application, integrating **React** for a dynamic frontend, **Flask** for an efficient backend API, and **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud-based data storage. The project is aimed at showcasing my full-stack development skills through the creation of a single-page application (SPA) that features RESTful backend services and flexible data management. It serves as a practical demonstration of building and deploying a modern web application from scratch.

## Technologies
